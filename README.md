# Getting Started with Project Glitter

There's this thing called _learning week_ in Autodesk where we take the week off our regular job, and learn whatever stuff we want to learn (except that I am not supposed to learn _cocktail making_ because that's kinda not relevant to my day job).

I'm from a web graphics team, and _AssemblyScript_ seems like a nice tech to learn, so I decided to make a super simple audio visualizer with it.

Here's how it looks like if you have this set up and running (except it'll be your face on the user icon and not mine, naturally):

-   Live demo [can be found here](https://benglin.github.io/project-glitter/)

## Environment setup

Here's a list of what you need to set things up:

-   Recent build of Node.js: [download from the official site](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

-   Clone this repo: `https://github.com/Benglin/project-glitter.git`

-   Navigate to `project-glitter` you've just cloned it to:

    ```sh
    $ cd project-glitter
    ```

-   Within `project-glitter` directory, install node dependencies:

    ```sh
    $ npm install
    ```

-   Start the development server (which will launch a browser):

    ```sh
    $ npm start
    ```

## What's next?

A week is rather short to pick up a _new-ish language_ (I'm used to _TypeScript_), this project gives me a perfect opportunity to get my hands dirty with _AssemblyScript_ (and indirectly, a little bit of _WebAssembly_). I may not continue to work on this but who knows, if I ever find time to play with it further, I might.

Meanwhile, have a good one! ðŸ˜‰
